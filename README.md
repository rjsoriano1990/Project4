**Goal:** Create a Text Spam Detector

**Data Source:** Weâ€™ll use a csv dataset of known spam and non-spam text to teach our algorithm to detect words commonly found in spams found on Kaggle.

**Tools:** *Python Pandas* to clean and prepare data as well as create our algorithm *HTML/CSS/Bootstrap* to create our website.
*JS* for website interactions.
*Tableau* for visualizations.
*Github Pages* to host our website.

**Optional:** We also potentially aim to collect whether the results are correct or false, from the user, and add this information to our database so that the machine can keep learning, if feasible.
